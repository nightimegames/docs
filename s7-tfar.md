# Ground
## Channel Guide
### SR Channels 
SR in Spartan groups work as follows, each : representing place value.

`Platoon`:`Squad`:`Team`

eg.

> `Spartan`:`1-4`: `X`

**For example:**
> *1-4, Team 3* would be on frequency `140` or `143`.

> *2-2, Team 1* would be on frequency `220` or `221`.

> *2-3, Team 2* would be on frequency `230` or `232`.

#### Note about specific SR frequencies
Generally, a team will never use their team specific frequency (*ex `143`*) unless they are conducting special business. Usually stick to your base frequency, for example if they were branching off to do something else, which is unlikely. Normally a team will maintain their Squad's frequency. This works in a heirarchical fashion, meaning that to speak to your parent group, you simply remove a place value.

General channels for Spartan groups are their platoon # followed by two 0's

> *Spartan 1* would be on general frequency `100`

> *Spartan 2* would be on general frequency `200`

> Special channel `107.7` is sometimes used for **command elements only**.

### LR Channels

> LR General: `50`

> 1st PLT: `51`

> 2nd PLT: `52`

## Setup Guide
In an ideal world, one should have binds set up for each of their relavent channels. For an infantry member of a Spartan group, these would be their SR general and SR specific. I personally recommend reconfiguring your binds to adapt to these requirements, and I recommend the following:
 
*(Controls -> Configure Addons -> TFAR in dropdown)*
- **LR TRANSMIT** - T
- **LR TRANSMIT ADDITIONAL** - Y
- **SR TRANSMIT** - Caps Lock
- **SR TRANSMIT ADDITIONAL** - Ctrl+Caps Lock

This allows you to both be LR capable if you are placed in a position requiring one, while also allowing easy and intuitive switching between relavent SR channels. 

Lets imagine an infantryman who is a member of Spartan 1-3, Team 4, so their SR Specific is `134`, and their SR General is `100`. These keybindings applied to our theoretical soldier allow him to monitor both channels and intuitively speak on his team specific one, while also maintaining relatively ergonomic access to the general channel.

# Aviation
A member of the aviation group has a far more complicated, but more stable radio setup. It requires that each person who is a member be on 4 channels at once, and they should be able to monitor and speak on all of them with reasonable efficiency. 

This involves the member's radio being set to both two SR channels *(SR(G) and SR(L/C)*, and their LR Radio being set to LR(G) and LR(L/C). I recommend specific channels *LR(L/C) & SR(L/C)* to be bound to the most intuitive keybind, in my bindings `CAPS` and `T`. 

These bindings may change for you, but I recommend sticking with the rule of thumb of binding the specific channels *LR(L/C) & SR(L/C)* to the user's two most intuitive keys to press, and putting *LR(G) and SR(G)* on auxillary keys.

## Channels and Binds once done
**GENERAL AVIATION CHANNELS (CTRL CAPS AND Y)** *(Put these on your left earphone)*
- SR General: `400` (SR A2) (CTRL-CAPS)
- LR General: `53.1` (LR A2) (Y)

**LOGI CHANNELS (CAPS AND T)**  *(Put these on your right earphone)*
- SR Logistics: `420` (SR CH1) (CAPS)
- LR Logistics: `53.3` (LR CH1) (T)

**CAS CHANNELS (CAPS AND T)** *(Put these on your right earphone)*
- SR CAS: `410` (SR CH1) (CAPS)
- LR CAS: `53.2` (LR CH1) (T)

## Binds 
(Controls -> Configure Addons -> TFAR in dropdown)
- **LR TRANSMIT** - T
- **LR TRANSMIT ADDITIONAL** - Y
- **SR TRANSMIT** - Caps Lock
- **SR TRANSMIT ADDITIONAL** - Ctrl+Caps Lock

# Medics
Comms layout for medics is much the same as aviation.
## Channel Guide
- LR Medical Lead: `70` (LR CH1)
- SR Med 1ST PLT: `71` (SR CH1)
- SR Med 2ND PLT: `72` (SR CH1)
